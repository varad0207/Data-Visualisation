# Data-Visualisation

How well can you trust online reviews and ratings if the same company showing the rating also makes money by selling movie tickets. Do they have a bias towards rating movies higher than they should be rated? The above question can be answered by performing Data visualisation using pyhton libraries like pandas and seaborn In this project I've performed data visualisation to determine if Fandango's ratings in 2015 has a bias towards rating movies to sell more tickets
